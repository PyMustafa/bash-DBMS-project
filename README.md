## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `install.sh` script:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PyMustafa/bash-DBMS-project.git
   cd bash-DBMS-project
   ```

2. Make the `install.sh` script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. Run the installation script with superuser privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo ./install.sh
   ```

Alternatively, you can run it directly with `bash`:

```bash
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Manual Inspection

It's a good idea to inspect the install script from projects you don't yet know. You can do that by downloading the install script first opening it in a text editor, looking through it so everything looks normal, then running it.
